<p>I am very passionate about physics, turns out that being passionate does not equate to being great at teaching it.</p>
<p>I was excited at the thought of teaching Physics, a thing that I&rsquo;m very passionate about and what I&rsquo;m studying currently. I&rsquo;ve prepared my carefully created slides
along with a funny intro, a bunch of physics topics, and some quizzes along the way. I was very prepared for it.</p>
<p>The very first day was just an opening event, along with their Pre-test during the afternoon. It was all very successful and my enthusiasm is very high
imagining teaching those kids physics, hopefully igniting their spirits into studying physics and enjoying it more. I even hope that there&rsquo;s some student
that I could hopefully inspire to take up Physics as their degree program.</p>
<p>The day finally came where I would be teaching. I started with my funny intro (I definitely think it is funny), and started teaching. The first topic was
Scalars and Vectors which is easily grasped by students and I see them actively participating on answering which is which. The next is vector addition.
We started with one dimension where you can just add or subtract them. Then the 2D vectors came in where you&rsquo;re going to use the Pythagorean theorem for it.
I thought that this would be easy for them as it is just basic trigonometry but I was surprised that some students don&rsquo;t know it (I&rsquo;m looking at you DepEd).
I taught some trigonometry crash course for a second but this is just a foreshadowing of problems to come.</p>
<p>We passed on some more trigonometry which I can sense that the students can&rsquo;t fully grasp, which is a problem considering that physics is very math-heavy.
We moved on to Motion which started with some definitions of some terms in which my students can finally understand again. The difference of distance
and displacement is easy, then speed and displacement, which started some equations once more and I can see that the students are grasping very little of it,
then we go to UARM, which was literally just equations. I can see that almost no one understands it at a glance. It&rsquo;s a problem that I didn&rsquo;t expect
since this event was supposed to be a crash course of physics, not me teaching physics from scratch. I thought that this would be easy, but it was very far from that.</p>
<p>From there, we delved into more equations, in which I try to explain in a &ldquo;physical sense&rdquo; and not in &ldquo;equation form&rdquo; to at least let them grasp the
topic a little. But I can see that only few are actively listening and maybe one or two actually understands what I&rsquo;m teaching. My motivation,
from very high is now so low. After I finished teaching one section, I expected that the other two sections that I&rsquo;ll be teaching will be the same.</p>
<p><strong>I messed up.</strong></p>
<p>I should&rsquo;ve focused more on things that they could understand and focused on it instead of dumping them with all the knowledge that I understand but
they wouldn&rsquo;t understand. I tried to fix my teaching in the other two sections but still, what I prepared was a mess. I couldn&rsquo;t let them understand it.
Albert Einstein said it himself, <strong>“If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself”</strong>. What more that I can&rsquo;t teach high school students
basic physics? I
recieved some comments that I was intelligent, that they couldn&rsquo;t understand what I&rsquo;m saying. I took that as a blow. I failed as a lecturer.  It was a wake up call for me that
I failed. I was ashamed of myself but what could I do?</p>
<p><strong>I partly blame the education in the Philippines.</strong></p>
<p>You might think that this is me just blaming others about my shortcomings, but I think students should at least know those topics because I&rsquo;ve been in high school too,
and I&rsquo;ve learned those in high school. Yes, I&rsquo;m from a Science High School but the education needs to be the same for everybody. The education system must be changed.
I&rsquo;m also not blaming the teachers because they are also underpaid and overworked due to our system.</p>
<p>Despite those, I&rsquo;m grateful for that opportunity because I learned a lot about myself and others. The next time that I&rsquo;ll be teaching someone, I need to understand
where are they coming from. What do they know? This failure taught me what I need to learn. There is indeed only success and learning, you only fail if
you didn&rsquo;t learn. I thought that I&rsquo;ll be teaching kids physics before the event but I ended up learning about teaching.</p>
<p>Thank you, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/upmindorenos2007">UP MINDOREÑOS</a> for the opportunity and I also want to thank the students for trying to understand what I taught.
I apologize for failing as a lecturer. Thank you, and I will be better the next time around.</p>
